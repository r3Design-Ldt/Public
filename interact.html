      <h2 class="section-title">Mixed Reality Overlay</h2>
      <p>
        Our Interact module takes advantage of passthrough cameras on headsets like Meta Quest 3 to overlay your virtual design onto the real world.  Hold up your hand and see the virtual part resting on your palm.  Place the design on your workbench and walk around it to view it from every angle.  Because the virtual and real coordinate systems are synced, you can gauge dimensions and ergonomics accurately before cutting any material.
      </p>
      <p>
        For large assemblies, you can scale the model down to fit your environment or teleport to different viewing points.  A ghosted outline of your design appears on the table, and as you make adjustments in real time, the update is reflected instantly.  This interplay between virtual and physical spaces fosters intuition and reduces iterations.

      <h2 class="section-title">Intuitive Interaction Controls</h2>
      <p>
  Interact introduces natural ways to manipulate models.  Use your grip buttons to pick up and move parts, rotate them with wrist motions and scale them with pinch gestures.  Snap components together by bringing them into contact and feel a haptic confirmation.  You can also draw directly onto real surfaces, a virtual pen extends from your hand, letting you sketch alignment guides and notes in mid-air.
      </p>
      <p>
  For more precision, switch to controller-mode: the joystick moves components along axes, while the trigger locks movement to a single plane.  Numerical input panels appear on your wrist, letting you type exact offsets or rotations.  These controls make fine adjustments fast and ergonomic, blending the best of VR freedom with CAD-like accuracy.

  <!-- Section: Collaboration &amp; Multi-User -->

  <h2 class="section-title">Collaboration &amp; Multi-User</h2>
      <p>
  Prototyping rarely happens in isolation.  With multi-user sessions, multiple team members can inhabit the same virtual space.  Avatars appear as translucent outlines, and you can see each other’s controllers and headsets.  Collaborators can grab and move parts, point out details with virtual lasers and leave pinned comments in 3D space.  Voice chat is spatialized, making it easier to focus on whoever is closest to the design.
      </p>
      <p>
        A shared whiteboard floats to one side of the environment.  Anything drawn on it is visible to everyone, and sticky notes can be added to annotate specific components.  When the session ends, all notes and positions are saved with the project, ensuring that decisions and insights are never lost.
      </p>

    <!-- Section: Example Interaction Scenario -->

      <h2 class="section-title">Example Interaction Scenario</h2>
      <p>
        Suppose you’re designing an adjustable lamp stand.  After creating and simulating your parts, you enter Interact to check the ergonomics.  You place the virtual lamp on your desk using passthrough.  The hinge feels too low, so you grab the arm and drag it upward until the height feels comfortable.  A teammate joins remotely and suggests widening the base for stability.  She draws a quick sketch on the whiteboard, and you adjust the design accordingly, watching the geometry change in real time on the desk.
      </p>
      <p>
  This rapid feedback loop, design, simulate, interact, empowers you to converge on final designs quickly.  When you’re happy with the adjustments, you save the changes, export the files and head to the laser cutter.  No surprises await you there, because you’ve already experienced the product in context.
