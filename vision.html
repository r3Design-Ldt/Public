      <h2 class="section-title">Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
  Traditional prototyping can be expensive, time-consuming and inaccessible.  Designers often rely on guesswork when translating their ideas into physical objects, leading to countless iterations and material waste.  There’s a fundamental gap between the digital tools we use to create and the real-world processes that bring those designs to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students and makers lack an engaging way to visualize how their 2D or 3D designs will translate once cut from acrylic, wood or other materials.  The disconnect leads to frustration, especially for beginners who may not understand laser cutter constraints and design limitations.

          <p>
            r3Design solves this problem by immersing designers in a virtual workshop. With a VR headset, you can sketch and refine your design in three dimensions. Our built-in laser simulation engine previews the exact cutting path, complete with speed and material interaction, enabling you to validate your design before committing a single sheet of material.
          </p>
          <p>
            r3Design fits seamlessly into existing workflows by supporting common design exports. Users can bring sketches into other tools if needed, review them in VR and then export ready-to-cut files. The system also leverages mixed-reality passthrough so you can overlay your design onto the real world at true scale, providing invaluable spatial context.

      <h2 class="section-title">Innovation & Impact</h2>
      <p>
  r3Design is more than a tool. It’s a paradigm shift for makers.  By marrying immersive virtual design with real-world fabrication, we shorten the feedback loop and lower the barrier to entry for laser cutting.  The result is fewer mistakes, faster iteration cycles and a newfound ability to experiment fearlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
  Through classroom deployment, r3Design empowers students to visualize geometry, measurement and fabrication processes in ways that textbooks cannot convey.  Makers gain an intuitive understanding of scale and material behaviors.  And industry professionals can accelerate product development by catching design flaws early.

      <h2 class="section-title">Where Next?</h2>
      <p>
  The vision doesn’t end here.  Imagine sharing your VR prototypes across a network of makers, collaborating in real time, or using AI driven suggestions to optimize material usage and structural integrity.  r3Design lays the foundation for a future where fabrication becomes as fluid and creative as drawing on paper.
