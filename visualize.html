      <h2 class="section-title">Draw in 3D Space</h2>
      <p>
        Visualize provides an intuitive drawing environment within virtual reality.  Unlike flat screens, VR immerses you in your design, making it easier to sense depth and relative size.  Use your controllers to draw freehand strokes, precise lines and arcs.  Create layers on different planes, switch between orthographic and perspective views, and toggle snap grids to ensure accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those accustomed to CAD, Visualize offers familiar tools such as rectangles, circles and polygons.  You can annotate dimensions, set constraints and label key points.  As you draw, you can zoom in and out, rotate your workspace and teleport around your canvas for different perspectives.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Organize & Edit</h2>
      <p>
        Once sketches are laid down, Visualize makes editing straightforward.  Select lines or groups of lines to move, scale or rotate them.  Use trimming and extending tools to clean up intersections.  Organize your design into layers or groups for easy toggling and editing.  Our intelligent constraint solver helps you maintain relationships like parallelism or perpendicularity as you refine your work.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also assign materials or colours to parts of your sketch to preview how different materials might look when laser cut.  Each annotation and property will carry through to the simulation and fabrication stages, ensuring consistency throughout the pipeline.

      <h2 class="section-title">Example Workflow</h2>
      <p>
  Imagine designing a custom phone stand. You start by drawing the outline of the base and back support on different planes. Using the line and arc tools, you sketch the profile, constrain the angles and specify dimensions. With layers, you separate decorative engravings from structural elements. After refining curves and aligning edges, your sketch is ready for assembly and simulation within the app.
