            Begin your journey on the visualization board. Here you can sketch lines, curves and complex patterns directly in a virtual 3D workspace. Unlike traditional 2D software, you are surrounded by your canvas allowing you to perceive depth, scale and proportion with ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            The intuitive drawing tools support freehand strokes, straight edges and geometric primitives. You can draw on different planes, switch between orthographic and perspective views, and precisely control dimensions. Every change is instantly visible in VR, reducing guesswork and sparking creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you’re outlining a simple box or tracing an intricate mandala, the Visualize tool helps you get ideas out of your head and into a tangible form. From here, you can refine and build upon your design using the Create tools.

            Once your outlines are defined, use drawing tools to create shapes and lines that form the basis of your design. Snap, align and duplicate elements to build up more complex patterns and assemblies. The VR environment enhances spatial understanding so arranging parts feels natural and intuitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grouping and duplication speed up iteration, letting you explore alternatives without starting over. Everything you compose is ready for simulation and review within the application.

            Before you cut, simulate. The Simulate engine reproduces the laser’s path, speed and material interactions in real time. Watch the laser travel across your design, leaving a glowing path and showing any problem areas. Adjust settings such as power and speed to see how they affect the cut quality and time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simulation helps you catch overlaps, incomplete paths and geometry that the cutter cannot process. You can see where the laser starts, where it lifts and how it moves between segments. This process prevents costly mistakes and wasted material in real life.
          </p>
          <p>
            For educational purposes, the engine visualizes the physics of laser cutting giving students insight into how energy, speed and material properties interact. No more surprises when your design hits the laser cutter.

            Step into mixed reality. With compatible headsets like Meta Quest, r3Design projects your design into your physical space. Walk around it, scale it to real world size, and see how it fits within an environment. This contextual understanding is invaluable when designing products for human use or specific spaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Interact mode isn’t just about viewing it’s about feedback. Grab parts, stretch them, rotate them and watch them snap back into your design. Collaborate with teammates as they observe from different angles. It’s like holding the object in your hands before it exists.
          </p>
          <p>
            By overlaying virtual prototypes onto real desks, walls or floors, you can assess ergonomics and aesthetics without wasting material. This is the future of design evaluation.
